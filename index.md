## _Me As A Programmer_
```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello there!");
    }
}
```
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello there!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello there!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

I just said hi to you using the coding languages I know. As a senior of Math-CS major, I learned many practical skills of computer science, such as
- [x] OOP
- [x] Data Structure
- [x] Algorithms
- [x] Computer Architecture
- [x] Digital Circuits Design
- [x] Computatibility and Cryptography
- [x] A little Front End(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## _Me As A Person_
>_“明知不可而为之”_

>_”Do it knowing it is impossible“_

Above is my favorite phrase in Chinese. As an international student from China, I started to study abroad since Sophomore year of high school. This quote has being motivating me to move forward to every new chapter of my life.

I have a lot of hobbies for the tiny free time I have besides course work:
* Badminton
* Cooking Chineese Cuisine
* Calligraphy
* Art + Degital Design
* Books & Movies
* Puzzles & LEGOs
* Room Escape

I'm a trilinguist:
* Native Speaker of Chinese
* Fluent in English
* Conversational in Japanese
* And the next one I'm planning to learn is Korean

I also attached some of my old painting, sketchs, and calligraph practices if you are interested.
