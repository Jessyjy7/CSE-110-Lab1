## _Me As A Programmer_
```

int main() {
    printf("Hello there!\n");

Above is my favorite phrase in Chinese. As an international student from China, I started to study abroad since Sophomore year of high school. This quote has being motivating me to move forward to every new chapter of my life.

I have a lot of hobbies for the tiny free time I have besides course work:
* Badminton
* Cooking Chineese Cuisine
* Calligraphy
* Art + Degital Design
* Books & Movies
* Puzzles & LEGOs
* Room Escape

I'm a trilinguist:
* Native Speaker of Chinese
* Fluent in English
* Conversational in Japanese
* And the next one I'm planning to learn is Korean
